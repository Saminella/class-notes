# Lectures
- [[DCN230_Lec0]] 
- [[DCN230_Lec1]] Introduction to Networking
- [[DCN230_Lec2]] IPv4 Addressing and Subnetting
- [[DCN230_Lec3]] Network Models
	- Purpose of 'models'
		- for devices to be able to communicate 
	- TCP/IP model
	- How is data sent
		- data broken into 'segments' then sent
			- purpose of segmentation 
		- receiver puts data together in 'resegmentation'
	- PDU's (Protocol Data Units)
		- Data
		- Segment
		- Packet
		- Frame
		- Bits
	- De-encapsulation 
- [[DCN230_Lec4]] Networking Technologies
	- Data Link Layer
		- main purpose
	- Data Link Layer 'Sublayers'
		- LLC (Logical Link Control sublayer)
		- MAC (Media Access Control sublayer)
	- Media Access Control 
	- Serial connection vs Ethernet connection
	- Different types of 'frames'
		- Point-to-Point 
		- Ethernet
			- Ethernet 2
	- Difference between 'physical topology' and 'logical topology'
	- Common physical WAN topologies
		- Point-to-Point
			- example of 'serial' connection
		- logical point-to-point connection
	- Common physical LAN topologies
	- Half-duplex vs full-duplex
- [[DCN230_Lec5]] Ethernet
	- describe operation of Ethernet sublayers
	- identify the major fields of the Ethernet frame 
	- describe the purpose and characteristics of the Ethernet MAC address
	- compare the roles of the MAC address and the IP address
	- describe the purpose of ARP
	- explain how ARP requests impact network and host performance 
	- explain basic switching concepts

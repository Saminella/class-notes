# Progress

### Tentative Project Timeline 
1. decide on what 10 CIS compliance tasks for each role 
2. setup github 
	1. connect each member's control node to the shared repo 
3. make VMs?
	1. do we even need to make VMs?
	2. make vms
4. start to map out roles 
	1. what tasks for each role depending on selected CIS benchmarks
5. make shared inventory 
	1. decide on ip address assignment



# Questions
- do we each make a control node or one control node for entire project? 
	- how do we coordinate it
	- 1 for demo 
- shared inventory on github? 
	- ansible vault will help with this
- for the lead role
	- what is audit_compliance and security reporting 
		- jinja2 generated reports? 
	- hint to what modules to use and lectures to focus on
- github
	- each manage different branches
	- then merge together

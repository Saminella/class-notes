## **Overview of CIS Compliance**

The **Center for Internet Security (CIS)** provides best practices for securing systems against cyber threats. CIS develops **configuration benchmarks** to help organizations improve their security posture. These benchmarks ensure systems are securely configured, reducing vulnerabilities and exposure to attacks.

### **Why is CIS Compliance Important?**

- **Enhanced Security** ‚Äì CIS benchmarks ensure secure configurations for operating systems and applications.
- **Industry Standards** ‚Äì Compliance aligns with industry regulations and cybersecurity frameworks.
- **Risk Reduction** ‚Äì Prevents security misconfigurations and reduces vulnerabilities.
- **Audit & Compliance Readiness** ‚Äì Simplifies security audits and regulatory compliance efforts.

## **Project Objective**

This project leverages **Ansible** to automate **CIS compliance tasks** on **Windows and Ubuntu systems**. Students will:

- Develop **Ansible Playbooks** to enforce security configurations.
- Modularize configurations using **Ansible Roles**.
- Secure sensitive data using **Ansible Vault**.
- Generate **dynamic compliance reports** using **Jinja2**.
- Implement **robust error handling** to enhance automation reliability.
- **Collaborate effectively** using GitHub for version control and documentation.

## **Deliverables**

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Automated CIS Compliance Tasks**

- Implement **10 CIS compliance tasks (each)** for **Windows** and **Ubuntu** systems.
- Ensure configurations follow **Ansible best practices**.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Dynamic Role Implementation**

- Organize automation tasks into **Ansible Roles** for modularity:
  - `cis_ubuntu`: Manages CIS compliance for Ubuntu.
  - `cis_windows`: Manages CIS compliance for Windows.
  - `audit_compliance`: Implements security auditing and reporting.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Security Using Ansible Vault**

- Secure all sensitive credentials (e.g., SSH keys, Windows passwords) using **Ansible Vault**.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Dynamic Jinja2 Reporting**

- Use **Jinja2 templates** to generate **dynamic compliance reports**.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Comprehensive Playbook Execution**

- Develop a **main playbook (`main.yml`)** that invokes all relevant roles.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Debugging and Error Handling**

- Implement **robust error handling** using `assert`, `fail`, `block`, and `rescue`.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ **Version Control and Collaboration**

- Maintain a structured **GitHub repository**:
  - Meaningful **commit messages**.
  - Organized **project structure**.
  - Clear **documentation (README.md, contributions, execution instructions, etc.)**.

### 8Ô∏è‚É£ **Final Presentation**

- Deliver a **10-minute group presentation** covering:
  - **Objectives and outcomes**.
  - **Demonstration of playbooks**.
  - **Challenges and solutions**.
  - **Lessons learned and future improvements**.

## Cognitive Bias
- systemic error in thinking that occurs when we process and interpret info in the world around us and affects the decisions and judgements we make 
- often, the brain simplifies things which can lead to bias 
- slow changes are hard to recognize
- how biases affect on the way we think 
	- make it difficult for people to exchange accurate info or derive truths 
	- distorts critical thinking 
	- leads us to avoid info we are uncomfortable with 
	- lead us to see patterns and connections that are not real 

#### Types of Biases

	- tendency to listen more often to info that aligns with our beliefs 
- hindsight bias
	- tendency to see past events in a predictable way even when there was no way to determine that in the moment 
- anchoring bias
	- tendency to focus on a single source rather than all 
	- ex: focusing on the first source you encounter, hearing a random number can lead you to think a different way (ex: a jacket is listed as $300 seems too expensive, BUT if it says it used to be $600 it makes it seem like a good deal)
- actor-observer bias
- false consensus effect 
- halo effect
- misinformation effect
- self serving bias
- optimism bias 
	- tendency to overestimate the likelihood that good things will happen 
	- happens in cybersecurity a lot 
		- ex: we won't be attacked 
- availability heuristic
	- tendency to use info that is easy to remember (ex: sensational events)
- functional fixedness 

### Tips for Overcoming Bias
- be aware of bias 
	- your bias and the biases of others 
- consider the factors that influence your decisions

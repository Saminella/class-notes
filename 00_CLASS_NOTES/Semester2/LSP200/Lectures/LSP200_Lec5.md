# LSP200_Lec5
# Critical Thinking and Clear Writing 
#### Agenda 
- identify types of ambiguity
	- understand your audience 
- understand ambiguity in cybersecurity
- definitions to increase precision and clarity 

## Vagueness 
- sometimes intentional 
	- like politicians
- more often unintentional 
- vagueness is annoying 
- might have different definitions for terms you think are common
	- ex: what does 'major' entail? 
	- ex: 'reckless' driving, what is considered 'reckless'?
- occurs when the boundaries of word's meaning are not well defined
	- ex: large, significant, big
	- focus on quantifiable facts instead of ambiguous descriptors 


### Syntactic ambiguity 
- occurs when a claim is open to 
- sentence construction is abiguous 


## 3 x 3 Writing Process
pre-writing
- planning 
	- analyse the **purpose**
		- to inform, persuade, explain, describe, instruct, build trust 
- analyse
- anticipate
	- anticipate the audience
		- prior knowledge, are they decision makers, what industry, 
		- most audience member think "what's in it for me" and "what am I supposed to do with this information"
			- communication must be useful from the reader's perspective 
		- what language is appropriate
			- jargon
		- tone (formal/informal)
		- will receiver respond positively or negatively to the message
			- ex: if the purpose was to get them to invest in better infrastructure, might not respond positively if not knowledgeable 
	- use verbs that describe practical actions 
		- ex: choose, decide, solve, identify etc..
		- very direct 
	- avoid mental state verbs
		- ex: learn, know, understand 
		- too subjective 
	- 3 main categories of readers (audience)
		- decision makers
			- big picture 
			- say how the organization will act when confronted with a choice or problem 
		- advisors
			- provide info and advice to decision makers
			- interested in detailed
			- data analyse and evaluate 
		- implementers 
			- carry out the decisions
			- what do you want me to do
			- why do you want me to do it
			- how should I do it
			- how much freedom do I have to achieve the results
			- what is the deadline 
		- in real life, might be writing for combined audience 

Writing
- research
- organize
- compose

Revision 
- revise

# The Cost of Poor Communication
- focus on single purpose for each message 
- include info readers want and need, nothing more

## How to provide the exact content your readers need
- identify audiences goals and questions 
- find superstructure (genre) that suggests questions your readers will ask 
	- ex: if writing an incident report, follow the common structure for an incident report
	- write reports based off the industry or company standards 
- avoid including info your readers don't need
	- smaller sentences (8-20 words)
	- 8 sentence paragraphs

Passive vs Active voice
- most times use active voice
	- to focus on the doer
- use passive voice when talking about negative things
	- ex: an employee oversight caused the error 
	- to focus on the action 


Parallel structure
- good for instructions 
- similarity in writing 

Coherence 
- dovetailing 






# Revision 
- revising 
	- improve content and sentence structure 
- proofreading 
	- correct grammer, spelling etc.. 
- avoid common phrases
- unbury verbs 
	- unbury verbs are needlessly converted to wordy noun expressions
